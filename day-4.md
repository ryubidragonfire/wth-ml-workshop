# 17th March 2017

## All knowledge accumlulated here are provided by the workshop participants.

## Please get ready the following BEFORE the workshop:
- load iris data into `dataframe`
- split the data into training and test set
- train a k-nn classifier
- have www.7-zip.org/ program downloaded (for imdb dataset)

## How well the model is performing?
- what metrics do sklearn provide
  -?
- **confusion matrix**

## Today's lab
- [Hands-on exercise](https://github.com/ryubidragonfire/python-machine-learning-101/blob/master/model-evaluation.ipynb)

# Group project
- 4 groups, each group with 2-3 members
- define a classification question
- build a classifier that can answer that question
- suggest: come in every Friday to disucss with your group member and work on it.

## github
- create a repo for your project, with your team members as `contributor`. 
- you are not allowed to leave the workshop, until you get this done :)

## imdb dataset
- http://www.imdb.com/interfaces, click on either of these:
 - ftp.fu-berlin.de (Germany)
 - ftp.funet.fi (Finland)
- imdb dataset prepared by [chuansun76](https://www.kaggle.com/deepmatrix/imdb-5000-movie-dataset)
  - download this one
  - visualise the dataset
  - what questions to ask? 
  - what are the possible solutions (limit this to classification, for now)?

## imdb example
- https://blog.nycdatascience.com/student-works/machine-learning/movie-rating-prediction/

lots of examples of manipulating the data set here:
